          <p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Step 1: Download this short audio biographical recording.  </p>
<p>Step 2 Listen to it. </p>
<p>Step 3: Take a look at the considerations below and in your own time create a task for the person who sent it to you, which you believe could positively change their mind!</p>
<p>Things to consider:</p>
-  Can you pinpoint something about this person that you would like to help change?
-  What habits do they have (positive and negative)?
- Do they have any unrealised dreams?
- Can you see something they canâ€™t ?
<p>Directions:</p>
-  The task should last between a minute and a month; it could be a one off or something to be repeated.
-  It can be as ambitious as you like, but bare in mind financial and time restrictions (the task must be achievable).
- Empathy is key; when listening to the autobiography try and build a task that has their unique character at the heart of it.
